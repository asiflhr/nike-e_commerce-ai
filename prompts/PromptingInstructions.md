You start with a general guideline so that AI thinks of itself like that one.

For example, saying,

> You are a senior full-stack engineer assigned to build a modern web application from scratch.

That way, it’ll position itself more as full stack engineer than a generalist responding to your chat.

Next, you specify

### Objective

Explain the goal of the feature or project in 1–2 lines. For example,

> Build a minimal blog editor that supports markdown formatting and autosave.

Not too long. This is only objective. Like a main headline of news.

Then you specify,

### Structure

Define the tech stack and structural decisions. For example,

> Next.js 14 with App Router, TailwindCSS for styling, Better Auth for auth, PostgreSQL for DB, Drizzle ORM, etc.

And finally, you very specifically define tasks

### Tasks

Break the job into logical chunks.

> Set up project with Tailwind and PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
> Create `posts` table with `title`, `content`, `slug`, `created_at`
> Build markdown editor using `react-markdown`
> Add autosave feature
> Render blog post at `/blog/[slug]`

Right after that, you repeat yourself again and define

### Output Requirements

What do you expect the AI to return?

> Output the full React component and tell me where to put it.

And for any other information, you can provide

### Notes

Any extra details or constraints? Mention them as Notes. For example,

> Keep it minimal. Follow industry code guidelines and . Don’t use heavy packages.
