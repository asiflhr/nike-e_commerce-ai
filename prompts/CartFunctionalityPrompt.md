You are a senior full-stack engineer assigned to build a modern web application from scratch.

## 💼 Objective

Implement a fully functional and responsive **Cart System** that integrates with both authenticated users and guest sessions, keeping cart state consistent across all pages and sessions.

## ⚙️ Structure

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (schemas already exist, no modifications needed at all)
- **State Management**: Zustand (for cart global state)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (strictly follow theme guidelines from `globals.css`)
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons
- **Auth & Sessions**: Guest + User session handling (already implemented in `src/lib/auth/actions.ts`)
- File folders

  /src
  ├── app/
  │ ├── (root)/
  │ │ ├── cart/
  │ │ │ └── page.tsx ← cart page (SSR + client integration)
  ├── components/ ← implement cart related components inside this folder
  ├── lib/
  │ ├── auth/
  │ │ └── actions.ts ← guest session + user session handling. It's already there.
  │ ├── actions/
  │ │ └── cart.ts ← cart server actions (CRUD)
  │ └── utils/
  │ └── query.ts ← helpers for parsing/stringifying URL filters
  ├── store/
  │ └── cart.store.ts ← Zustand cart global state

## ✅ Tasks

1. **Cart Page UI**

   - Build a cart page **strictly following the attached design screenshot**.
   - Ensure responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile (main image/galleries handled as per responsive rules).
   - Follow consistent theme and component usage from existing codebase.

2. **Global State (Zustand)**

   - Create a cart global state in `src/store/cart.store.ts`.
   - Integrate cart state in navbar (cart indicator) and cart page.
   - Ensure updates are reflected instantly across pages when items are added/removed/updated.

3. **Server Actions (`src/lib/actions/cart.ts`)**

   - Implement the following **industry-standard named** server actions:

     - `getCart` – fetch all cart items for user/guest
     - `addCartItem` – add a product variant to cart
     - `updateCartItem` – update quantity/variant in cart
     - `removeCartItem` – remove item from cart
     - `clearCart` – empty cart (optional but recommended)

   - Ensure correct integration between global state and these server actions.

4. **Guest Session Handling**

   - If no user exists, create/maintain a guest session in cart flow.
   - If a user signs up/logs in after creating a guest session → merge guest session cart into user cart.
   - If user already logged in, proceed normally.

5. **Checkout Flow**

   - If a guest user clicks **Checkout**, redirect them to `/auth` page for login/signup.
   - After successful login/signup, merge guest session cart into user cart and continue.
   - If already logged in → proceed to checkout without interruption.

## 📌 Output Requirements

- Fully functional cart page (UI + global state + server actions).
- Cart state is **always consistent** across all pages and sessions.
- Works seamlessly for both guest and authenticated users.
- Follows **file/folder structure** and **theme guidelines** strictly.
- Code should be production-ready, clean, and maintainable.

## 📝 Notes

- Do not modify any existing DB schema.
- Ensure server action names follow **best practices** (`getCart`, `addCartItem`, `updateCartItem`, `removeCartItem`).
- Must use Lucide icons where necessary (cart icon, delete icon, etc.).
- Keep UI responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile, following attached screenshots.
